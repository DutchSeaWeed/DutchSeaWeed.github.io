        <h2>Hello, my name is Siebe Wiersma. I am a Software Development student at Sint Lucas in Eindhoven.
            I grew up being interested in programming because of my father. He has been a webdeveloper my entire life .
            I am currently learning html css and javascript. I also know a little c#. I want to build games and learn as much as there is to know about game development.
            My email adress is siebewiersma@gmail.com and my phone number is 0622406978.
            In this design file I have gathered inspriration that I got from other websites, written text about some of the projects I have worked on, and added some pictures.
            I have made a flowchart showing the structure of my portfolio website.
