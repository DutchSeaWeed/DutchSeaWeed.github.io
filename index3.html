        <h2>Hello, my name is Siebe Wiersma. I am a Software Development student at Sint Lucas in Eindhoven in The Netherlands.
            I grew up being interested in programming because of my father. He has been a web developer longer than I am alive.
            I am currently learning html, css, javascript and c#. I think knowing how to build websites in fun, but I don't want to do it
            professionally. I want to build games and learn as much as there is to know about game development.
            My hobbies are playing, designing and creating video games. I love history and older technology related to gaming.
            Working in groups is something i can do well, and I want to help people where ever I can.
            My email address is siebewiersma@gmail.com and my phone number is 0622406978.
