        <h2>This game was originally going to be a version of the game Fireboy Watergirl. 
            In this game there are 2 characters who each have their own specialty that 
            they must use to solve the puzzles and reach the end. 
            Me and my teammate wanted to have 3 characters in each level. One very strong character
            that could push things out of the way, 
            one mage character who would be able to reach buttons high up by firing projectiles 
            and a third character who would have to first reach an item like a potion to make a 
            bridge appear and finish the level.

        <h2>The only problem with this was that it had to be a mobile game and since we didn’t have enough
            time to figure out how to build servers so that 3 players with each their own phone were able to
            play with each other. We decided to have only 1 character per level with the level they were in
            having obstacles that fit with the character’s ability. I would build the characters while my
            teammate would build the levels.
            I also wanted to draw simple characters and animations to make it
            more obvious which character was which. </h2>
