        I did this project with a group of 7 other people. Me and 1 other programmer built the game while a team of designers made
        the player sprites, background, obstacles such as traps and spikes and the blocks that we used to build the floor and platforms.

            The assignment for the designers was to choose one of the themes and think of a project surrounding that theme.
            I had nothing to do those 3 weeks because we as programmers had to wait for the designers to think of something. After that we
            all came together and talked about each person's ideas. The idea we decided to make a reality was a game about running endlessly
            through while collecting energy drinks to go increase the speed. The game was going to have randomly generated parcour that would
            difficulty because of the higher speeds.
