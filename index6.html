    For this project I combined 2 assignments together.
    For 1 class I had to make something to challenge myself.
    I had to create a goal for myself that had to relate to coding and building games and explain
    why it was a good goal. My goal was to learn how to create a system to switch between characters.
    For the other class the theme was what is creativity, so I made my game representative of the way
      I make up things for my projects.

      The gameplay was you are a character that is stuck in a maze without any knowledge of what is going on.
      As you walk around you can find items like a hat and a shield. These items are meant to be picked up even
      though itâ€™s not clear why they are there. As you walk around you will find out what to do with the items
      you find, and you will find new people to help you find everything. These people are a small character
      and a character that breaks through certain walls. Switching characters is done by clicking on the
      character you want to become.
