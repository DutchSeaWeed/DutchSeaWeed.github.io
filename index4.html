    <h2>This was my first game that I made independently.
        Itâ€™s a simple roguelike where the player must find the exit
        while fighting through a random map with a random number of enemies.

        The map consists of 100 rooms in a 10-10 grid.
        At the beginning of the game each room has a chance to spawn in which creates the random aspect.
        This can lead to the first room and the final room not being connected to each other,
        so that when happens the rooms will continue to randomize until a playable map is created.

            When the player enters a room 1-3 enemies will spawn in.
            They will automatically go to the location of the player, and when they collide the player will take damage.
            Only when all the enemies are dead the player can continue to the next rooms.
            The player can kill the enemies with a gun that aims at the location of the mouse.
            Shooting works just by clicking anywhere on screen.
            It will fire a projectile that kills the enemies in 3 hits.
            To make sure that the player can reach the end healing items may be dropped when an enemy dies.
